## Build
- Install "CMake" and "Make"
	* sudo apt install make
	* sudo snap install cmake (snap has newer version)
- ```mkdir build```
- ```cd build```
- ```cmake ..```
- ```make```
- You will get "rocket-game" executable. Enjoy!

May take some time for first build because of building SDL2. Further builds are fast
